# Social App Client

## Introduction

This is a [PROJECT IVORY](https://github.com/ElhamNorouzi) repository for a picked up free design from [uplabs.com](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/social-app-ui-2) website written
in kotlin using MVVM design pattern that containes 5 screens "Login, Signup, forgot password, friend list and chat room" screens. I've implemented each screen and it's
functions  end to end from scratch server side and client side with CLEAN Archtecture and made it ready to be customized on your project if you wish to use it just clone
this project and start customizing.

It's a playground application I've been doing on my spare time to play with jetpack compose, compose material 3 and having a socket connection that allows users to chat and have conversations
with each other, also I've written it's backend server side using [Ktor server](https://ktor.io) and [Kmongo DB](https://litote.org/kmongo) as my database.

To have a full cycle working application (celint and server) please clone the [social-app-server](https://github.com/ElhamNorouzi) and do what's listed there in the read me file and have fun with it.
